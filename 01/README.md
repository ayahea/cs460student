CS460 Computer Graphics at UMass Boston.
Notes: 
I noticed that the PDF did not load my avatar when viewing it on GitHub, the PDF needs to be downloaded to display the avatar.
The avatar screenshot is not the best quality--the link we were instructed to use did not work on Chrome or Edge on my laptop so I had to open it using Safari on my phone, and then took a screenshot and transferred to my laptop from there.
